doi: `10.1002/9780471729259.mc13c01s9`

- Typtone: 20-g
- Yeast Extract: 10-g
- Glucose: 5-g
- Cysteine (free base): 1-g
- Salts solution "A": 40-mL
  - `CaCl_2*H_2O`: 0.26-g
  - `MgSO_4 * 7H_2O`: 0.48-g
  - `KH_2PO_4`: 1-g
  - `NaCl`: 2-g
  - "Mix `CaCl2 · 2H2O` and `MgSO4 · 7H2O` in 300-ml `H_2O` until dissolved.
    Then add 500-ml `H_2O` and add remaining salts. When dissolved add 200-ml
    `H_2O` and store at 4°C."
- Hemin sol'n: 10-mL
  - For 200 ml: Dissolve 100 mg of hemin in 2 ml of 1 M NaOH and then bring up
    volume to 200 ml with dH2O. Store in an amber bottle at 4°C.
- Resazurin solution (0.1%): 1-mL
  - Dissolve 0.1 g of resazurin (Sigma Chemical Co.) in 100 ml distilled water.
- Agar (if required): 15-g
- NaHCO3 (10% sol'n): 20-mL
  - "Dissolve 50 g into 500 ml H2O, filter sterilize."

"All of the components except NaHCO3 are added to 930 ml of H2O. Then adjust pH
to 7.0, and autoclave for 20 min. When media has cooled to 55°C add sodium
bicarbonate solution."
